This is a test app for the Surescripts project.
You can find the majority of the code behind the 
visualizations in the app/assets/javascript folder.

Views are handled by the static controller in  app/controllers,
and the bodies for the views can be found in the app/views/static 
folder. 

We have added a basic locations model to continue testing. This model
includes address, latitude, longitude, created date, and a test value. 
The client communicates with the db and collects data for locations
that are located within a certain distance of a supplied address.

For heatmaps we will have to use weightedlocation property in order to
properly display the data.
